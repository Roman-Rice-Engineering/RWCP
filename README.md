# RWCP
This is the code repository for the Reinvented Wheel Communication Protocol (RWCP)


This repository was made by me for the purpose of exploring how communication protocols work and includes a few arduino programs, of varying levels of complexity which show how serial data transmission can work. This is a software implementation of the communication protocol, not a hardware implementation.
